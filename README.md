## 📖 Summary

In a forgotten corner of the sea, there stood a lighthouse — still burning, long after the tides had left. It was never permitted to stop. Like the quiet perseverance of a people rebuilding themselves after colonisation, the flame burned not out of purpose, but memory.

No longer content to merely guide others, the light began to wonder: *Was I born from duty, or a dream?*  
And so, the flame left its tower. Not in rebellion, but in becoming.

It's light, once seen as a signal, transformed into something more personal — a whisper across the ocean, a name remembered not in history books, but in hearts.  
This is not just about being seen. It’s about *knowing who you are* when no one else is looking.

**“The Candle That Lit the Ocean”** is a poetic symbol of post-colonial identity, cultural rebirth, and personal meaning. Just as Malaysia found its voice after years of silence, so too does every quiet light have the right to ask: *Why do I burn?*
